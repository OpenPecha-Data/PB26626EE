Extremely Concise Dedication
by Ācārya Aśvaghoṣa

dak ni jinpé sönam kyi
Through the merit of my generosity
nyé ké sangye nyi tob né
May I attain buddhahood, so rarely found.
rabmé sipé gyatso lé
And thereupon may I liberate all beings
semchen malü drolwar shok
From the unfordable ocean of existence.
